Problem Statement 

Let's be real: trying to keep track of everything in your head or across random sticky notes is a nightmare. Tasks get forgotten, and you end up spending energy on minor stuff while the important things pile up. We need a dead-simple, reliable place to dump our tasks, figure out what's urgent, and keep tabs on what's done. That chaos? That's what this little tool is built to fix.

SCOPE 
This project is a back-to-basics command-line tool—think of it as a super-organized checklist you run in your terminal. We’re using Python and a simple dictionary to hold all the data.

This project focuses on 
The core job of a to-do list: getting tasks in, seeing what's on the plate, marking them complete, bumping up the priority on critical items, and deleting old junk. It's a single-session tool for now.

What this project currently does not include
Saving the list to a file so it remembers everything next time you open it (no file storage/persistence), making a fancy visual app (no GUI), setting calendar alerts, or letting multiple people use the list at once. Just a solid, standalone task manager.

Target Users Specifically, this is perfect for:

Students: Who need to keep their assignments, reading lists, and project deadlines straight. Anyone at Home: Who needs a simple list for errands, shopping, or household chores without downloading yet another phone app.

High-Level Features

   Quick Task Entry: Get a new task into the system fast, and immediately flag it as High, Medium, or Low priority.

   See Everything: Pull up the full list anytime to view all your tasks, priorities, and their current status in one clean overview.

Stay Flexible:

 Need to pivot? Easily change a task's priority level if things suddenly get more urgent.

 Finished it? Mark tasks as 'done' right away (or switch them back to 'pending' if you realize you missed something).

 Clean Up: Remove completed or obsolete tasks from the list permanently.
